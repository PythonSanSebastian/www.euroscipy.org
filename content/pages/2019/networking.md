### Pintxos

![](../static/2019/pintxos.jpeg)

[Pintxos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pincho) are snacks, usually consisting of a mixture of
ingredients on top of a small slice of bread. Traditionally, they are accompanied by a small
glass of wine (_txikito_) or beer (_zurito_), and moving from a place to another after every
pintxo, or couple.

There is a strong socializing component in eating pintxos, that we would love to bring at
EuroSciPy. Join the conference <a href="https://t.me/euroscipy">Telegram group</a> to discuss
the <a href="http://www.bilbaoturismo.net/BilbaoTurismo/en/rutas_2">pintxos route</a> of every
day.
