Would you really love to join EuroSciPy but can't afford it? We can help you!

Thanks to the support of [NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org/),
the [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf/),
and the [EuroPython Society](https://www.europython-society.org/),
we are offering a financial aid program to support people who may need it in order to join the conference.

We offer two types of financial aid grants:

- **Free ticket**: The ticket includes access to 2 days of trainings + 2 days of talks + 1 day of sprints
- **Travel and accommodation costs**: We will partially cover the travel costs (hotel / transportation)

#### Grant Eligibility

Our program is open to all people with lack of budget.
We can give limited numbers of subsidies,
that's why we will focus on the next criteria for evaluation:

- **Diversity**: We are looking for the most diverse EuroSciPy conference.
- **Contributors**: Speakers/trainers of EuroSciPy, active people from small Python
communities, and contributors to community projects.
- **Economic factors**: Students, unemployed or people with difficult economic situation.

reimbursed by bank transfer after the conference. Please, upload your receipts

be considered rejected by the applicant
