<a name="tutorial-space"></a>
You register for one of the two tutorial tracks (introductory or advanced)
but you can switch between both tracks whenever you want as long as there is
enough space in the lecture rooms.
Because experience from the last conferences show that the demand for the
advanced track is greater than the one for the beginners track, the advanced
tutorials will be in larger lectures room.
This room is big enough to hold all attendees.
Therefore, all tutorial attendees will be able to attend the advanced
tutorials, if they which.
Based on past years numbers, the room for the beginners tutorials is also large
enough to seat all beginner track attendees.
