# Simpler data science: dirty categories and scikit-learn updates

This talk will touch upon two packages that hope to make machine learning
easier, dirty_cat [1], and the lesser-known scikit-learn.

Dirty-cat strives to make it easier to work with categorical data that
contain variations in the categories, such as typos, variants of company
names, or open-ended input. It uses simple, off-the-shelf, vectorization
of the categories in a way that is robust to morphological variants.

I will also give an update on scikit-learn: upcoming features, and the
striving health of a happy community.
